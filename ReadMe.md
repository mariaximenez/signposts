I am building an app that helps a user stay accountable to a set goal through a daily check-in with a group/community. The check-in will consist of a 500 character or less reflection on the actions, thoughts, and feelings that arose when attempting to commit to the set goal. 

I can implement a user model and a group model with a one-to-many relationship. The user can be apart of other groups, but it is more likely that they will focus on one group. Each group will have a goal attribute.

Users can sign-up for the app, and then log-in to their profile page. The profile page will display their goal, group name, individual group member usernames, the posts they created, and the badges they earned for daily check-ins. On the profile page, you will be able to add users to your group, delete and update your past posts

There will also be the accountability reflection page where all the users of a specific group can add their goal reflections. Goal reflections will be displayed by date. Goal reflections will also have space for comments.

User Stories: Who is your user?

My user has a common goal shared with friends, such as eating healthy, exercising more, quitting a bad habit like smoking, or a commitment to be more mindful, connected, or adventurous.

Users want to achieve their goals but not as a loner who clenches their fist through the process, but in a community with trusted friends to support and encourage their progress and help them process the shame of setbacks.
